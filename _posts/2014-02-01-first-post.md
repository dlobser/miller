The miller's wife had waited long,<br>
      The tea was cold, the fire was dead;<br>
And there might yet be nothing wrong<br>
      In how he went and what he said:<br>
"There are no millers any more,"<br>
      Was all that she had heard him say;<br>
And he had lingered at the door<br>
      So long that it seemed yesterday.<br>

Sick with a fear that had no form<br>
      She knew that she was there at last;<br>
And in the mill there was a warm<br>
      And mealy fragrance of the past.<br>
What else there was would only seem<br>
      To say again what he had meant;<br>
And what was hanging from a beam<br>
      Would not have heeded where she went.<br>

And if she thought it followed her,<br>
      She may have reasoned in the dark<br>
That one way of the few there were<br>
      Would hide her and would leave no mark:<br>
Black water, smooth above the weir<br>
      Like starry velvet in the night,<br>
Though ruffled once, would soon appear<br>
      The same as ever to the sight.<br>
